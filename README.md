This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles that leads to npm install failures in multi-stage builds. The issue stems from how context is handled when copying files between stages.  The original `Dockerfile` attempts to copy the application code after running `npm install` in a separate stage, but the context from the previous stage is not correctly passed. The solution modifies the `Dockerfile` to ensure that the necessary files are copied *before* `npm install` is executed, resolving the error.
